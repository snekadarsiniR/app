    <h2>THE SILENT PATIENT</h2>
    <h4>By: Alex Michaelides</h4>
    <body>
        <p>Alicia Berenson, a famous painter, is held guilty for the murder of her husband, photographer Gabriel Berenson. Due to a plea of diminished responsibility, she is admitted to a secure forensic unit called the Grove. Theo Faber, a forensic psychotherapist with a keen interest in the Berenson case, successfully applies for a position at the Grove. At his request, he is placed in charge of Alicia, who has not spoken since the day of the murder. Although she remains mute during their therapy sessions, Alicia gives Theo her diary. In it, she describes being watched in her home by a masked man in the weeks before the murder. Theo, in the meantime, discovers that his wife, Kathy, is having an extramarital affair with an unknown person.

            To learn more about Alicia, Theo contacts her cousin. He narrates an incident from their childhood that had happened shortly after her mother's suicide. Alicia's father, in deep mourning for his wife, wished out loud that Alicia were dead instead. Theo understands that this has had a deep impact on her psyche. He repeats the episode back to her, which induces her to speak. She tells him that the masked man entered her house and murdered Gabriel.
            
            It is revealed, in a twist, that Theo was the masked man. He had broken into the Berenson house to confront Gabriel, who, in another twist, had been having an affair with Theo's wife, implying that the novel was being told in two different timelines. Holding them at gunpoint, Theo had given Gabriel the choice to save either himself or his wife, and he chooses the former. Theo left without shooting either of them, as he had only intended to expose Gabriel's selfishness. Gabriel's betrayal reminds Alicia of her father, and she killed him. On hearing the news, Theo planned to help Alicia recover from her trauma by being her therapist.
            
            When Alicia tells Theo the false story of the masked man, he realizes that she recognizes him. He puts her into a coma through a drug overdose. Unbeknownst to Theo, Alicia records the events in her diary before losing consciousness, which is found by the police. They go to Theo's house and start reading him Alicia's final entry, while he feels a sense of relief at being caught.
