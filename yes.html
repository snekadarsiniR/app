    <h2>YES PLEASE</h2>
    <h4>By: my Poehler</h4>

        <p>he book received mixed reviews from literary critics. Laura Miller reviewed the book for The Guardian and said, "Yes Please is unable to make a virtue out of its author’s lack of sharp edges. In person, Poehler can do this, and it’s a remarkable achievement, but on the page she tends to wax bland."[4] Similarly, Dwight Garner of The New York Times was not pleased with the book by saying: "Yes Please reminds you of that squeaky fact: Even smart, hilarious people, the ones you wish were your great friends, sometimes can't write."[5]

            Mary McNamara writing for Los Angeles Times was more positive about the book, and said: "Not everything in Yes Please works [...], but many things are funny, and as with most of her comedy". McNamara also said that the writing is "choppy and self-consciously eccentric" and added: "[Poehler] is a smart and funny woman who isn't either of those things all the time and doesn't mind admitting it because she thinks that's important too".[6] Rachel Dry of The Washington Post commented: "So she is funny and honest. Writing a book is hard, and that seems to be the truth. At least she made some good jokes about it.
