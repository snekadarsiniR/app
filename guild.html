    <h2>THE ADVENTURERS GUILD</h2>
    <h4>By: Zack Loren Clark and Nick Eliopulous</h4>
    <body>
        <p>In one of the last cities standing after the world fell to monsters, best friends Zed Kagari and Brock Dunderfel have high hopes for the future. Zed desperately wishes to join the ranks of the Mages Guild, where his status as Freestone’s only half elf might finally be an asset. Brock, the roguishly handsome son of merchants, is confident he’ll be welcomed into the ranks of the Merchants Guild.

            But just as it seems the boys’ dreams have come true, their lives take a startling turn . . . and they find themselves members of the perilous Adventurers Guild.
            
            Led by the fearsome Alabasel Frond, the guild acts as the last line of defense against the Dangers—hungry, unnatural beasts from otherworldly planes. And when the boys uncover a conspiracy that threatens all of Freestone, Zed, Brock, and their new allies—Liza, a fierce noble, and Jett, a brave dwarf—must prove their worth once and for all.
            
            This start of a thrilling new series is sure to be a hit with readers who like their fantasies clever and action-packed, with tons of humor and heart.
