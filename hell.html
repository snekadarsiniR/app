    <h2>THE HELL BENT KID</h2>
    <h4>By: Charles O Locke</h4>
    <body>
        <p>The Hell Bent Kid,[A] is Tot Lohman, the protagonist of the book, a mild mannered teenager but a crack shot with a rifle. Lohman kills a man from the Boyd family,[1] near Twist, Texas, in self defense, and the vicious and numerous Boyd family is set on revenge. Lohman flees to New Mexico Territory to seek his father. The journey, across desert canyon country and pursued by the Boyds, is arduous and dangerous, which mirrors his internal journey of conscience.[2][3]

            The Hell Bent Kid was selected by the Western Writers of America as one of the twenty-five best Western novels ever written.[2] It was adapted into the 1958 movie From Hell to Texas.
