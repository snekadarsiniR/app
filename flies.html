            When the sun goes down and the shadows thicken, the coming darkness begins to change habitats everywhere. Even a trail you frequent on a regular basis is suddenly transformed as different animals roam about after a long nap during the day. Many creatures depend on the darkness that takes over while we sleep. They depend on it to find food, to be hidden in the shadows for survival, and to find a mate.
            
            One of these creatures that thrive in the night are fireflies – and now through July is your best chance at seeing them in Minnesota. <br>
            
            Many of us remember the magic of being out late at night catching these bugs that light up the darkness. You may recall gazing at their pulsing light through a glass jar or watching them blink inside your hands before letting them fly away. 
            
            Fireflies evoke a sense of wonder and delight.<br> Finding yourself surrounded by their flashing lights makes you feel like time stands still and that all is right in the world.
            
            Where I grew up, fireflies didn’t exist; we had glowworms instead, a slightly different species that rely on steady bioluminescent light to find a mate. When I first experienced the flashing of fireflies, I felt like I was in a different world.
            
            This began my deep interest in these little creatures, and I came across research that astounded me!
