    <h2>THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE</h2>
    <h4>By: Shirley Jackson</h4>
    <body>
        <p>
            Steven Crain is an author known for The Haunting of Hill House, an autobiographical novel about his childhood experience while residing in the haunted mansion with parents Hugh and Olivia, and younger siblings Shirley, Theo, Nell and Luke. During their stay, the Crains encounter paranormal occurrences and are forced to flee without Olivia, who dies within the house, traumatizing the rest of the family. Years later, Steven used his family's traumatic experiences to write his book, straining the bonds with his siblings. Although it became a best-seller, he missed most of the frightening experiences and does not actually believe in the paranormal. Theo meets a woman, Trish, at a nightclub and brings her home to have sex. Steven and Shirley miss calls from Nell, who then calls Hugh and expresses concern for Luke, who has become a drug addict. When Steven returns home, he finds Nell standing there. He receives a call from Hugh, informing him that Nell went to Hill House and is dead. Steven realizes that Nell is a ghost.
            In childhood flashbacks at Hill House, Shirley encounters a box of abandoned kittens and takes them in. However, the kittens all end up dying, which deeply affects Shirley, who obsesses over why she could not fix them. Later, during Olivia's funeral, an initially distraught Shirley is in awe that the mortician was able to "fix" her mother and return her previous beauty. As an adult, Shirley is a mortician who owns a funeral business alongside her husband, Kevin, and rents a guesthouse to Theo, who is now a child therapist. Shirley is informed of Nell's death. Distraught, she decides to embalm and "fix" her sister herself. However, while doing so, she encounters her mother's ghost.
